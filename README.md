# PINN Lab

I started getting familiar with the theory of **PINNs** by first looking at easy 1D PDE examples. The goal is to achieve some kind of **parameter estimation** from artifical measurement data for these simple cases and then extend the framework to more complex geometries in higher dimensions until we can eventually apply them to our real world specimens. 

The neural networks are set up with **tensorflow** .
